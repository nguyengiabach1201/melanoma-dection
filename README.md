# Melanoma Detection
Detect early-stage of skin cancer

## Dataset
I used a dataset on Kaggle which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images)

## Training
I created 2 versions for the training. Use can use Kaggle to train this model or use your own PC (but I think you should you Kaggle because of its durability and convenience)
