# Melanoma Detection
Detect early-stage of skin cancer

## Dataset
I used a dataset on Kaggle which you can find [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hasnainjaved/melanoma-skin-cancer-dataset-of-10000-images)

## Training
I created 2 versions for the training. Use can use Kaggle to train this model or download and use your own PC (but I think you should you Kaggle because of its durability and convenience)

## Using
Download the `model1` folder and run `main.py` with the following struct:
- Have the path to the model folder
- Have name of image files need to be checked

And at the end, we have something like this
```
python main.py C:\Path\model1 melanoma1.jpg melanoma2.jpg
```
